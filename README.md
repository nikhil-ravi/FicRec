# RecFic

Welcome to Fanfic Explorer, your go-to platform for discovering fanfics across various fandoms in a whole new way! This web application utilizes cutting-edge technology to provide you with personalized fanfiction recommendations based on your search prompts.

## How It Works

1. **Data Scraping:**
   We scraped metadata from fanfiction.net for a vast collection of fanfics across different fandoms (only ASOIAF for now, more coming soon), capturing key details about each story.

2. **Embedding Summaries:**
   Leveraging the capabilities of Hugging Face's transformers.js library, we utilized the Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to embed summaries for each fanfic. This process provides a concise representation of the story's essence, capturing as much as a summary can reveal.

3. **Pinecone Integration:**
   [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) serves as the backbone of our platform, functioning as a robust vector database. It empowers our system to execute queries that efficiently search for fanfics with similar content stored in the database.


4. **On-the-Fly Transformation:**
   When you enter a search prompt, the transformer model is downloaded once and stored in your browser cache. Subsequent use of the model occurs on-the-fly, directly in your browser. This design enables real-time and dynamic exploration of fanfiction without the need for repeated server-side processing, ensuring super-fast responses for an optimized user experience.

5. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   By querying Pinecone with the vectorized search text, we fetch the top 10 most relevant fanfics, tailored to your input.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:**
  The entire platform is built as a Next.js project, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

- **Hugging Face's Transformers.js:**
  We harness the transformers.js library to run the embedding process directly in your browser, eliminating the need for external server calls.

- **Pinecone:**
  Pinecone serves as our backend for similarity search, ensuring fast and accurate recommendations.
